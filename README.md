# Service Monitoring Tool

A web application built with Remix that allows you to scan websites for broken links and pages.

## Features

- Crawls a given URL to find all internal links
- Checks each link for 404, 500, or other errors
- Returns detailed reports on any broken pages found
- Provides both a web interface and API for scanning

## API Usage

The application exposes a REST API that can be used to scan websites programmatically.
